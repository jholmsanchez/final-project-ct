    <p>Now that you know about the parts that go into your computer, it's time to build! Below is a step-by-step
        guide to walk you through each part of the process. </p>
    <section>
        <h2>Step One: Getting started</h2>
        <p>First, you'll want to make sure you have some tools ready. You'll need screwdrivers, a thermal paste applicator
            if your CPU cooler doesn't already have thermal paste applied, zip/cable ties to secure and organize cables
            and something to cut them with, pliers to hold screws and help grip parts. You'll also want a small container
            to hold the screws so they don't get lost. It can also be helpful to have access to a first aid kit nearby
            just in case of any accidents. Make sure you ground yourself and your work area before starting to prevent
            any static electricity. You could get an anti-static wrist strap to help with this. Clear your workspace
            and make sure you have enough room to start building. You'll want a well lit area so you can see what you're
            doing clearly. A headlamp or flashlight will also be helpful for this.</p>
    </section>

        <h2>Step Two: Installing the Motherboard and CPU</h2>
        <p>Place your motherboard on top of a clean, dry, anti-static surface. Take a look at what socket type your CPU
            has. This is important because you don't want to bend or break the pins or latch that will hold the CPU in place.
            Once you do that, remove the plastic cover socket that reveals the slot for the CPU. Line up the CPU with the
            socket. There should be an indicator on which direction to place it. Once the CPU is in place, make sure it is
            secure and then close the retention mechanism and push down the latch. Be extremely gentle with the CPU and make
            sure you don't push or force it into place.</p>

        <h2>Step Three: Installing the RAM</h2>
        <p>You'll want to check the motherboard manufacturer guide to know which slots to place the RAM into. There will
            be labels on the motherboard that indicates what each slot is connected to. Leaving the slots closest to the
            CPU open improves stability and speed. Push down the tabs at the end of the slot where you plan on installing
            the RAM. Look for the notch on the stick and line it up with the matching post then line up the grooves in
            the slot. It is easier to line up one side at a time. Next, you'll want to push the RAM into place until you
            feel resistance and then keep pushing until the tabs at the end of the slot push back into place. Be careful
            not to be too forceful. If it is done properly, you'll hear a click when the tabs lock back into place.
            Repeat this process with any other sticks you plan on installing.</p>

        <h2>Step Four: Installing the SSD</h2>
        <p>You can take a look at the manual for the motherboard to see where the SSD slots are if you aren't able to
            find them. You'll want to unscrew the phillips screw on the standoff (if applicable). There may also be a
            standoff included in the box with your motherboard that you'll have to twist into place on the 2280 position.
            There is also a 2260 and 2242 slot you could place the standoff in depending on the size of your card.
            Insert the pin side of the SSD into the slot at a little bit of an angle and then lower the back of the drive
            onto the standoff and screw it into place.</p>

        <h2>Step Five: Installing the CPU cooler</h2>
        <p>To install the CPU cooler,start by installing the backplate. To do so, lift the motherboard carefully and line
            up the backplate with the four holes on the back. Your backplate may or may not have screws with them. Next up is
            installing the mounting brackets. Start by removing all the fans off the cooler. You'll need to screw in the
            mounting brackets either on the sides of the cooler or onto the motherboard. If your CPU cooler doesn't have thermal
            paste already applied, your cooler should include a tube of it. Either way make sure there is thermal paste applied
            to the CPU before making contact with it. After placing down the cooler, apply a small amount of pressure to help
            spread the thermal paste.

        <h2>Step Six: Prepare the Case and Install the Motherboard</h2>
        <p>Now is a good time to start preparing to put your motherboard in the case. Before you start, it may be helpful
            to place your case on top of a blanket or towel to avoid scratching the PC case or whatever surface you are
            working on. Place the side panels of the case somewhere safe like back in the box to avoid breaking them. Once
            the side panels are off, install the I/O shield if you have one. Line it up to the cutout on the back of the case
            and snap it into place.</p>
        <p>To begin installing the motherboard into the case, start by installing the standoffs. There will be screw holes
            in the motherboard tray inside the case. You'll want to match these holes with the ones on your motherboard
            and screw in the standoffs. Next, carefully place the motherboard into the case making sure it matches with
            the ports near the I/O shield and onto the standoffs. After that, secure the motherboard by using the screws
            provided. Make sure the screws are tightened evenly and avoid over tightening to prevent damage. You can now
            connect your cables for the CPU known as EPS connectors. You'll find these near the top left of the motherboard
            but refer to your motherboard's manual if you're unable to find them.</p>
        <p>After that, it's time to attach the front panel connectors which are made up of the power and reset switches,
            power LED and HDD LED, and the front USB and audio. Refer to your manual on where you can find the pin layout.
            Finally, you'll want to connect the SATA cables for your SSD. You should also connect any case fans to the motherboard's
            fan headers at this time.</p>

        <h2>Step Seven: Installing the PSU</h2>
        <p>It is now time to connect the power supply unit. You'll need to find the mounting space for it which is usually
        near the top-rear or bottom of the case. Once you find it, slide the PSU into place and secure it using screws.
        You'll need to figure out which cables you'll be using. You'll need the ATX, EPS, PCI and any SATA cables for things
        such as drives or fans. Make sure the PSU is switched off and don't plug it into the wall until you finish installing
        and double-checking everything.</p>

    <section>
        <h2>Step Eight: Installing the GPU</h2>
        <p>Look for the PCIe slot on your motherboard, usually located around the CPU. Remove the metal brackets that will
            reveal the GPU ports. Next, insert the GPU by aligning the gold connector on the GPU with the open PCIe slot.
            Push down gently until the card is in place. Screw in the GPU using the screws from the metal brackets. This will
            secure it in place. Now you'll want to connect the PCI cable from the PSU. Do a final check to make sure everything
            is secured properly.</p>
        <p>Now is a good time to check over everything and manage your cables before turning on the computer. Make sure everything
            is in place properly and double check that there are no leftover screws or anything unnecessary still in the case.</p>

        <h2>Step Nine: Setting Up the Operating System</h2>
        <p>At last, it is finally time to start setting up the operating system. For this guide, I will be explaining how to
            install Windows. After installing the GPU, plug in your monitor, keyboard and mouse. You'll need
            a USB flash drive and a valid Windows license. You'll need to download the Media Creation Tool and create
            installation media for the USB flash drive. Complete the setup. Once you're done, insert the flash drive
            into the new computer. Turn it on and press the key for boot options according to your motherboard manual.
            Select the USB and once it loads, hit "Install Now". Enter the activation code and select which version you'll be
            using. Then you'll want to accept the license agreement and install Windows.</p>
