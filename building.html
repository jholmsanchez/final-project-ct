    <p>Now that you know about the parts that go into your computer, it's time to build! Below is a step-by-step
        guide to walk you through each part of the process. </p>
    <section>
        <h2>Step One: Getting started</h2>
        <p>First, you'll want to make sure you have some tools ready. You'll need screwdrivers, a thermal paste applicator
            if your CPU cooler doesn't already have thermal paste applied, zip/cable ties to secure and organize cables
            and something to cut them with, pliers to hold screws and help grip parts. You'll also want a small container
            to hold the screws so they don't get lost. It can also be helpful to have access to a first aid kit nearby
            just in case of any accidents. Make sure you ground yourself and your work area before starting to prevent
            any static electricity. You could get an anti-static wrist strap to help with this. Clear your workspace
            and make sure you have enough room to start building. You'll want a well lit area so you can see what you're
            doing clearly. A headlamp or flashlight will also be helpful for this.</p>

        <h2>Step Two: The Motherboard and CPU</h2>
        <p>Place your motherboard on top of a clean, dry, anti-static surface. Take a look at what socket type your CPU
            has. This is important because you don't want to bend or break the pins or latch that will hold the CPU in place.
            Once you do that, remove the plastic cover socket that reveals the slot for the CPU. Line up the CPU with the
            socket. There should be an indicator on which direction to place it. Once the CPU is in place, make sure it is
            secure and then close the retention mechanism and push down the latch. Be extremely gentle with the CPU and make
            sure you don't push or force it into place.</p>

        <h2>Step Three: Installing the RAM</h2>
        <p>You'll want to check the motherboard manufacturer guide to know which slots to place the RAM into. There will
            be labels on the motherboard that indicates what each slot is connected to. Leaving the slots closest to the
            CPU open improves stability and speed. Push down the tabs at the end of the slot where you plan on installing
            the RAM. Look for the notch on the stick and line it up with the matching post then line up the grooves in
            the slot. It is easier to line up one side at a time. Next, you'll want to push the RAM into place until you
            feel resistance and then keep pushing until the tabs at the end of the slot push back into place. Be careful
            not to be too forceful. If it is done properly, you'll hear a click when the tabs lock back into place.
            Repeat this process with any other sticks you plan on installing.</p>

        <h2>Step Four: Installing the SSD</h2>
        <p>You can take a look at the manual for the motherboard to see where the SSD slots are if you aren't able to
            find them. You'll want to unscrew the phillips screw on the standoff (if applicable). There may also be a
            standoff included in the box with your motherboard that you'll have to twist into place on the 2280 position.
            Line up the SSD with the slot on the motherboard.</p>
