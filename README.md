Indie Holm - Computer Technologies Final Project

My goal for this project was to create a website that serves as a guide to building a PC. There are three pages -
one to introduce the site, another to explain what parts you'll need and what they're used for, and a third page to 
explain each step of the building process including installing an operating system. (Windows)
My objectives include explaining different computer components to someone who may only have basic computer knowledge
and providing instructions on how to put the parts together to create a functional PC. This project was inspired by my 
own process of building my first computer and wanting to build another whether it be for myself or helping someone build
theirs. 
I used the following resources to help me put together this project:
