        <h1>Picking the Parts</h1>
        <p>In order to start building a PC, you'll want to have an idea of what parts you plan on using for the build.
            <a class="link" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPicker</a> is a great resource for this! It's a website
            that allows you to "build" a computer by selecting different parts that you plan on using.
            It will notify you of any compatibility issues between the parts
            and give you prices, availability, and where to buy the specific parts. Below, you will find the parts
            you'll need to begin!</p>

            <h2>Choosing a Case</h2>
            <p>A computer case is the outer shell of the computer and holds all of its components. You can opt for just
                a basic one, but there are many types to choose from depending on what you're looking for in terms of
                aesthetics, size, functionality, etc. Bigger cases are good for holding more drives, bigger graphics cards,
                a larger motherboard, etc. Smaller cases are convenient if you have limited space and don't plan on doing
                a huge build. You'll want to keep in mind which motherboard will properly fit inside the case. PC cases
                will typically list the motherboard formats that it is able to support.</p>

            <h2>CPU</h2>
            <p>The CPU, or Central Processing Unit, is essentially the brain of the computer. It is made up of an ALU
                (Arithmetic Logic Unit) and a control unit. The ALU performs arithmetic and logic operations and the
                control unit tells other computer components how to respond to instructions. Depending on what type of build
                you're going for, you'll want to consider a few things before choosing your CPU.</p>
            <p> The first thing you'll want to consider is the number of cores and threads. The more cores/threads a PC has,
                the better it will be at multitasking. What do you intend to use your computer for? Whether it be work tasks,
                gaming and streaming, content creation, etc., the more cores and threads in a CPU means more of an ability
                to handle multitasking. You'll also want to consider the clock speed. The CPU runs program instructions one
                by one, so a faster clock will allow programs to run faster. Keep in mind a faster clock also means more
                heat, so be sure to have a cooling fan. (Discussed later) A faster clock also means a higher electrical cost.
                Typically, newer generations of CPUs are better in terms of efficiency and speed, but this doesn't mean you
                have to go out and buy the newest, best CPU you can find. Again, you'll have to make sure it is compatible
                with whatever motherboard you choose.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Cooler</h2>
            <p>Another component you'll want to think about for your computer is a cooler. As previously stated, CPUs with
                faster clock speeds produce more heat, so you'll need one to avoid having your PC overheat. Overheating
                can cause crashing and freezing and long-term damage to your PC. CPUs will often come with a cooler, but
                if you plan on using your computer for more complex tasks, it can be good to get your own cooler
                in case of any overclocking that may happen. Keep in mind that if you buy a cooler, you'll also need thermal
                paste which allows heat to move better from the CPU to the cooler. Some coolers will come with thermal paste
                already applied.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>RAM</h2>
            <p>Next up is RAM (Random Access Memory). This is the part of the computer that stores volatile data, meaning
                the data is lost when the computer turns off. RAM affects the responsiveness and speed of the system. More
                RAM gives you the ability to run more programs at one time. Not having enough RAM may cause programs to run
                slowly and potentially cause crashes. </p>
            <p>The capacity of RAM you'll need depends on what you plan on using your computer for. Heavier tasks such as
                3D rendering will call for more RAM (64GB or more), but 16GB is good for general use and gaming. If you're
                looking to stream, you'll need more RAM, like 32GB. However, basic use like browsing the internet really
                only requires 8GB. More RAM doesn't necessarily mean better performance so only get as much as you need -
                you can always upgrade later on.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>SSD</h2>
            <p>A Solid State Drive stores data using non-volatile memory, meaning it retains stored data even when the power
                is shut off. SSDs help with multitasking and faster loading times for apps, games, etc. They come in different
                storage capacities so you can choose how much storage you need. </p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Motherboard</h2>
            <p>The motherboard is a circuit board in a computer that allows different computer parts to communicate with
                each other. The motherboard holds the CPU, GPU, RAM slots, storage drives, and expansion cards.
                When choosing a motherboard, keep in mind compatibility features and size.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Graphics Card</h2>
            <p>The graphics card, or GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) deals with rendering videos, images, and animations
            which are displayed on your monitor. Some CPUs come with an already integrated graphics card typically on
            laptops. You can opt for a dedicated GPU which is a card that you install onto the motherboard. These are
            more powerful and great for things like gaming. Make sure your GPU is compatible with your motherboard.
            Having a good graphics card will allow clearer, smoother images and videos.</p>

            <h2>Power Supply</h2>
            <p>Whereas the CPU is the brain of the computer, the power supply is essentially the heart of the computer.
                It sends power to all the parts in the computer. <a class="link" href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PCPartPicker</a>
                has a calculator so you can add up how much power your PC will be using so you can decide on the right
                power supply for your needs. When choosing a power supply, stick to reliable brands and avoid off name
                and super cheap brands. Some reliable brands include Corsair, Seasonic and EVGA. Do your research before
                landing on your power supply unit.

            <h2>Operating System</h2>
            <p>You'll need an operating system. An operating system is a program that manages detailed interactions with
                the computer hardware. Windows, Mac, and Linux are some examples of operating systems. Android and iOS
                are also operating systems for smartphones. You can choose the one you want to use depending on your
                preference and the type of hardware you plan on using. For the building guide, I will be explaining the
                steps to install Windows.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Monitor</h2>
            <p>The monitor is what you'll need to receive output from the computer. Depending on what you're using your
                computer for, you'll need to find a monitor with a good resolution, response time, and refresh rate. For
                example, a good monitor for gaming would have a resolution of 1080p or higher, a response time of 1ms-3ms,
                and a refresh rate of somewhere between 120Hz to 240Hz.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>Peripherals</h2>
            <p>Finally, you'll need a keyboard and mouse for navigation and output. You'll also need either headphones or
            speakers, and you can opt to get a microphone and webcam. You can choose these based on quality and your aesthetic
            preferences.</p>
